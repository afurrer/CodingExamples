CodingExamples
==============
These programs were written during my time as a student at Texas State Univeristy. 2011-2014

They are meant to show the different types of coding I have learned while I was a student there, I did my best to attach the assignment instructions where I could. 

The different languages that will be seen in this repository are: C++,Java,and MIPS32 Assembly.

Reproduction of this code is allowed where it does not violate academic dishonesty policies.
